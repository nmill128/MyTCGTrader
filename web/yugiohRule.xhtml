3 How to play
n How to Duel and How to Win
A single game is called a Duel, and a Duel ends when one player wins
or the game ends in a draw. Duels are played in sets of 3 called a
Match, and the winner of best 2-out-of-3 wins the Match.
n Winning a Duel
Each player starts a Duel with 8000 Life Points. You win a Duel if: you
reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0; if your opponent is unable
to draw a card; or if a card’s special effect says you win. If you and
your opponent both reach 0 Life Points at the same time, the Duel
is declared a draw.
Victory Conditions
• Reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0.
• Your opponent is unable to draw a card when they are
supposed to draw.
• Win with a card’s special effect.

Preparing to Duel
Before starting a Duel, follow these 4 steps. Also, make sure you
have all your extra items that your Deck might need, like a coin
or counters.
After greeting your opponent, shuffle your Deck thoroughly. Then you may
shuffle and cut your opponent’s Deck (be careful when touching your opponent’s
1 cards).
After cutting, place the Decks face-down in the proper Deck Zones on the field.
If using an Extra Deck with Synchro Monsters or Fusion Monsters, place it face-
2 down in the Extra Deck Zone.
Both players show each other their Side Decks, and record the number of cards in
it, also confirming that they have 15 or fewer cards (the cards should be counted
face-down). If you exchange cards between your Side and Main Decks after a
Duel, count the cards of your Side Deck for your opponent again to show that the
number of your cards remain the same.
3
Play rock-paper-scissors or flip a coin. The winner decides to go first or second
in the Duel. For your next Duels, the loser of the previous Duel decides who goes
first. If the previous Duel ended in a tie, determine who starts first in the next
Duel with another coin toss, etc.
Finally, draw 5 cards from the top of your Deck; this is your starting hand

Turn Structure
A Duel progresses in a series of turns which are divided into phases.
n Turns
During a Duel, players alternate taking turns. Each player’s turn
consists of up to six phases.
n Phases
You move through the phases of your turn in the order shown on the
right. You can only do certain things during each phase, as detailed
in this chapter.

Draw Phase
Standby Phase
This is the first phase. The player whose turn it is (the “turn player”)
draws 1 card from the top of their Deck. A player with no cards left
in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel. After you draw, Trap
Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated before proceeding
to the Standby Phase.
Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the
Standby Phase. If you do not have any of these cards on the field,
you can still activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards before
moving on to your Main Phase 1.
Main Action in this phase
Possible Other Actions
Draw 1 Card
Activate Trap Cards, Quick-Play
Spell Cards, etc.
Main Action in this phase
Possible Other Actions
Resolve card effects that happen
in this phase
Activate Trap Cards, Quick-Play
Spell Cards, etc.

Main Phase 1
This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon,
Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card’s
effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in
any order you want, but some actions have restrictions.
Possible Actions in this phase
Summon or Set a Monster
There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or
Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon
or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn.
Change Your Monsters’ Battle Positions
This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position
of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You
can change the position of each monster you control, except in
three cases. 1. You cannot change the battle position of a monster
that was played onto the field this turn. 2. You cannot change it
in Main Phase 2 if the monster attacked during the Battle Phase.
3. You cannot change it if you have already changed its battle
position once this turn.
Active a Card or Effect
You can activate Spell and Trap Cards, or the effects of Spell, Trap,
or Effect Monster Cards as many times as you want during this
phase, as long as you can keep paying any costs involved.
Set Spell Cards and Trap Cards
You can Set Spell and Trap Cards face-down in your Spell and Trap
Card Zone during this phase, as long as you have space.

Battle Phase
Now it’s time to battle with your Monster Cards! This phase is divided
into steps.
You do not have to conduct a Battle Phase every turn. Even if you
have a monster on the field, you can choose to either enter the Battle
Phase, or to proceed to the End Phase.
Possible Actions in
this phase
Battle with Monsters
Activate Trap Cards and QuickPlay

Flow of the
Battle Phase Start Step
Battle Step
End Step
Damage Step
The Battle Phase is split into 4
steps and is conducted in the
order shown in the diagram. The
Battle Step and Damage Step are
repeated each time you attack with
a monster.
How To Play
31
After you’ve resolved all your battles by repeating the Battle
and Damage Steps, and you have no more monsters you want
to attack with, announce to your opponent that you are ending
your Battle Phase.
In this step, the players calculate the result of the battle and
whatever damage is done. (See “Monster Battle Rules”, page 34.)
After finishing the Damage Step, return to the Battle Step.
Select 1 monster on your side of the field to attack with, and 1
of your opponent’s monsters as your attack target, and then
declare the attack. If your opponent does not have any monsters
on the field, you can attack directly. Play then proceeds to the
Damage Step. Afterwards, the attacking player returns to the
Battle Step, and repeats this procedure. Each face-up Attack
Position monster you control is allowed 1 attack per turn. You do
not have to attack with a monster if you don’t want to.
End Step
Damage Step
Battle Step
Start Step
This step starts the Battle Phase. The turn player should
announce “I’m entering the Battle Phase”. IMPORTANT: The
player who goes first cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their very
first turn.
How To Play
32
n Replay Rules during the Battle Step
After you’ve announced your
attacking monster and the attack
target monster during a Battle
Step, the attack target might
be removed from the field, or
a new monster may be played
onto the opponent’s side of the
field before the Damage Step, due
to a card’s effect. This causes a
“Replay.” When this occurs, you
can choose to attack with the
same monster again, or choose to
attack with a different monster, or
choose not to attack at all. Note
that if you attack with a different
monster, the first monster is still
considered to have declared an
attack, and it cannot attack again
this turn.
Declare your attacking
monster and your attack
target monster.
A replay happens!
Re-select a target
monster.
The
monsters
your opponent
controls change
before the Damage
Step.

Main Phase 2
End Phase
Possible Actions in this phase
Actions in this phase
Possible other actions
in this phase
Summon or Set a Monster
Change your Monsters’ Battle Positions
Active a Card or Effect
Set Spell Cards and Trap Cards
Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the
field which say “…during the End Phase…” in their text, resolve
those effects in this phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your
hand at the end of this phase, select and discard cards to the
Graveyard until you only have 6 cards in your hand.
If you conducted your Battle Phase, your turn moves to Main Phase 2
afterwards. The actions a player can perform in this phase are the same
as in Main Phase 1. However, if the player already did something in Main
Phase 1 that has a limit to the number of times it can be done, the player
cannot do it again in Main Phase 2. Consider if you want to activate and
Set Spell and Trap Cards, or Summon or Set a monster (if you didn’t do that
in Main Phase 1) based on your situation after the Battle Phase. Use this
phase to prepare for the opponent’s turn.
Resolve card effects which

Discard if you have more than 6
cards in hand
