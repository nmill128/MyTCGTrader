Magic the Gathering Guide to a Game:
Get a Deck:
You’ll need your own Magic deck. You’ll also need a way to keep track of both players’ life totals, as well as small items to
use as counters or tokens.
When you’re first getting started, you may want to pick up a ready-to-play deck, such as an intro pack or event deck, or
borrow a deck from a friend. After you’ve built up your collection, try building your own deck using the guidelines on page 15

Grab a friend:
To play a game, you’ll need an opponent! Your opponent will play against you using his or her own deck.

Start Game:
Each player starts at 20 life. You win the game
by reducing your opponent to 0 life. You also
win if your opponent has to draw a card when
none are left in his or her deck, or if a spell or
ability says that you win.
Decide which player will go first. If you’ve
just played the same opponent, the loser of the
last game decides who goes first. Otherwise, roll
a die or flip a coin to see who gets to decide.
Each player shuffles his or her deck, then
draws a hand of seven cards to start. If you
don’t like your opening hand, you can mulligan.
Shuffle your hand back into your deck and draw
a new hand of six cards. You can keep doing
this, drawing a hand of one fewer card each
time, until you decide to keep your cards.

Taking A turn:
Below are the parts of a turn. Each turn proceeds in the same sequence. Whenever you enter a new step or phase, any triggered abilities
that happen during that step or phase trigger and are put on the stack. The active player (the player whose turn it is) gets to cast spells and
activate abilities, then the other player does. When both players in a row decline to do anything and nothing is waiting to resolve, the game
will move to the next step or phase.
With each part of the turn is a description of what can happen during that part, if it’s your turn.
1. Beginning Phase
a. Untap step
You untap all your tapped permanents. On the first turn of the
game, you don’t have any permanents, so you just skip this step. No
one can cast spells or activate abilities during this step.
b. Upkeep step
This part of the turn is mentioned on a number of cards. If
something is supposed to happen just once per turn, right at the
beginning, an ability will trigger “at the beginning of your upkeep.”
Players can cast instants and activate abilities.
c. Draw step
You draw a card from your library. (The player who goes first skips
the draw step on his or her first turn to make up for the advantage
of going first.) Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.
2. Main Phase
You can cast any number of sorceries, instants, creatures, artifacts,
enchantments, and planeswalkers, and you can activate abilities.
You can play a land during this phase, but remember that you
can play only one land during your turn. Your opponent can cast
instants and activate abilities.
3. Combat Phase
a. Beginning of combat step
Players can cast instants and activate abilities. This is your
opponent’s last chance to cast spells or activate abilities that stop
your creatures from attacking.
b. Declare attackers step
You decide which, if any, of your untapped creatures will attack
and which player or planeswalker they will attack. Then they do
so. This taps the attacking creatures. Players can then cast instants
and activate abilities.
c. Declare blockers step
Your opponent decides which, if any, of his or her untapped creatures
will block your attacking creatures, then they do so. If multiple
creatures block a single attacker, you order the blockers to show
which is first in line for damage, which is second, and so on. Players
can then cast instants and activate abilities.
d. Combat damage step
Each attacking or blocking creature that’s still on the battlefield
assigns its combat damage to the defending player (if it’s attacking
that player and wasn’t blocked), to a planeswalker (if it’s attacking
that planeswalker and wasn’t blocked), to the creature or creatures
blocking it, or to the creature it’s blocking. If an attacking creature is
blocked by multiple creatures, you divide its combat damage among
them by assigning at least enough damage to the first blocking
creature in line to destroy it before assigning damage to the next
one in line, and so on. Once players decide how the creatures they
control will deal their combat damage, the damage is all dealt at the
same time. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.
e. End of combat step
Players can cast instants and activate abilities.
4. Main Phase
Your second main phase is just like your first main phase. You can
cast every type of spell and activate abilities, but your opponent can
only cast instants and activate abilities. You can play a land during this
phase if you didn’t during your first main phase.
5. Ending Phase
a. End step
Abilities that trigger “at the beginning of your end step” go on the
stack. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.
b. Cleanup step
If you have more than seven cards in your hand, choose and discard
cards until you have only seven. Next, all damage on creatures is
removed and all “until end of turn” and “this turn” effects end. No
one can cast instants or activate abilities unless an ability triggers
during this step.
